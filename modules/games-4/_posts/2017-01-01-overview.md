Games have limitless potenial. The technology is constantly evolving, and the audience ever growing. Game development is no longer limited to jumping on the heads of enemies or aligning candy. Today we see complex environments for education, sensory application, and cross-boundary communication, resulting in virtual worlds, interactive storytelling, and worlds more realistic than the one we wake up to.

You may not be at that stage of creation yet, but you're well on your way. As we conclude the class, you should reflect on all you've accomplished:

1. Created two websites: one that sold a product, and one that sold a narrative.
2. Learned and applied user experience design concepts like affordances and flow to an app prototype.
3. Combine all three in an interactive game designed and developed in professional software, most likely for the first time.

This is quite impressive, and I hope you have a handful of new tools to take with you into the yonder of digital interactive technologies.
