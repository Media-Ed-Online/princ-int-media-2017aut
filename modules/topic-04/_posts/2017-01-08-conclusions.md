"Renowned magazine illustrator and graphic designer Christoph Niemann is moving into the interactive realm with the release of Petting Zoo, an iPad app that injects touch-responsive animation into his distinctive design style.

"Petting Zoo [is an] interactive picture book, featuring 21 illustrated and animated animals. Each line-drawing creature reacts to various swipes and touches on the screen — push the bunny and it stretches like rubber. Run your finger along the alligator’s teeth and they bend out of the way like blades of grass, accompanied with soothing wind chime sounds.

Niemann says he’s been wanting to design something for the smartphone/tablet platform for many years. “There was a moment when I got the first iPhone,” he describes. “The interaction — you make a move and something changes on the screen — that’s something you can’t do with a mouse.” His attempt does a great job of capturing that responsiveness. Each chapter keeps the user engaged with its tactile, curiosity-engaging design. He taught himself how to code with J-Query and Javascript while prepping for the project, but ultimately relied on the programming skills of New York-based Jon Huang, with whom he built a series of on-the-fly online web-based games while at the 2012 Olympics for the New York Times. The pairing continues to spark his enthusiasm.

“It’s such a new and exciting field, and really, for once in my life I feel there’s a field that’s in a way, wide open. There’s a ton of apps, a ton of really great stuff out there, but I can sit down there with a developer and we can create something."
