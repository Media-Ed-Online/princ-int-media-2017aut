**Approx. Time to Complete:** 3 hours

Together using Adobe Xd, we're going to build a few app prototypes that will focus on **intuative features**, **graphics**, and designing **flow.** Please make sure you have installed or have access to Adobe Xd.

This secod Lab is for an example travel application for mobile, and uses additional graphics and properties to create a next-level visual prototype, the kind you may hand off to an interaction designer, programmer, or developer for production.
