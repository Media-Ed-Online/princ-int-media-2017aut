We'll get more in-depth with the **User Experience Design,** or UXD (most commonly called UX Design) field next Topic, but you should have a basic understanding going forward.

"**UX Design** is studying user behaviour and understanding user motivations with the goal of designing better digital experiences.""

UXD is one of those things that you don't realize is working until it _isn't_. Take, for example, the "Norman Door."

_It's not just you. Bad doors are everywhere._

"A so-called “Norman Door” has design elements that give you the wrong usability signals to the point that special signage is needed to clarify how they work. Without signs, a user is left guessing about whether to push or pull, creating needless frustration."
