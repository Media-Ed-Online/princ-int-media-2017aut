Before televisions and computers were affordable, viewing art was expensive. Unless you could travel to museams or exotic locales, most people experienced art through books and pictures. Now, screens have become our primary method of consuming art. Digital creative software has changed how we build for the outside world, but more importantly, it took art-making away from institutions and brought it into rural communities and homes.

This adventure is still fairly new in the history of human technology, and we're still learning how to properly communicate with affordances in design. And even the smallest moments can carry with them great messages, as you'll see with illustrator Christoph Niemann, who explores bridging dimension, physicality, and technology as he progresses through his career.

We'll also look at interactive technologies. With the advent of mobile applications in particular, **user-expierience design** (or human-centered design) has taken on a whole new importance. As patience levels dwindle and attention spans decrease, interfaces need to become intuative, understandable, and adaptable across boundaries like economic status, education, and langauge. Even the phone model itself.

"Mobile apps are all well and good, but what else?" User experience in design is _everywhere_. And I can think of a popular example we've all encountered at least once this week.
