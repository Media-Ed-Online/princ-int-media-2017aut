**Product design** (PD) is the design of consumer products that considers usability, human factors, ergonomics, and appearance while still maintaining function. **Industrial design** (ID) is very similar, but is most often used to describe large-scale (industry) manufacturing.

Before we return to strictly digital applications, I want to consider the relationship with have with "stuff" - the things we use every day and often forget that somebody, somewhere, designed them for us to use. How, maybe in a hidden way, they've shaped the way we live our lives.

### *Objectified*, Dir. Gary Hustwit (2009)

Objectified is a feature-length documentary about our complex relationship with manufactured objects and, by extension, the people who design them. It’s a look at the creativity at work behind everything from toothbrushes to tech gadgets. It’s about the designers who re-examine, re-evaluate and re-invent our manufactured environment on a daily basis. It’s about personal expression, identity, consumerism, and sustainability.

Through vérité footage and in-depth conversations, the film documents the creative processes of some of the world’s most influential product designers, and looks at how the things they make impact our lives. What can we learn about who we are, and who we want to be, from the objects with which we surround ourselves?

Please watch the film for this Topic's Group Think. Consider the age we live in, the products we use, and the way we form relationships or detachments to their design.
