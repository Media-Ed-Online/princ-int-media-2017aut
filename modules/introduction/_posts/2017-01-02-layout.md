This course will use two main resources for you to complete your homework.

## Homework
Homework is divided into four activity types:

1. _"Group Think" Forums_ - Discussions regarding the materials found on this website.
2. _Labs_ - Small exercises or responses to writing prompts.
3. _Topic Projects & Workshops_ - 3 creative projects designed based on the practices learned through Topics.
4. _Final Project & Workshop_ - A multi-part project of your choosing from our 3 core fields (web site, app prototype, or game clone).

### Course Website
This website is the main repository for your learning materials. While there may be additional questions or prompts posted on Moodle, the majority materials you'll encounter will be through this website.


### Moodle
Moodle will contain all your assignments for the semester. You will use it to access "Group Think" forums, labs, and Workshops. It will also be where grades are recorded, and where you can communicated with your Instructor and TA.
