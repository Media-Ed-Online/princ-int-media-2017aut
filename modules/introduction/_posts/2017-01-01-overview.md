## Overview of the Course
This course is designed to help students gain the skill sets necessary to successfully create work in the constantly evolving digital environment. It covers the fundamentals of interactive website elements, prototyping, and game development, with a focus on evaluating user testing and addressing user challenges in these media. Our journey covers a lot in very little time, studying the principles of interactive experiences and the group processes that make them successful.

## What to Expect
Over the semester, you will explore sub-topics from 3 core fields:
1. IXD (interaction design) in Web Practices
2. UX (user experience) in Application Practices
3. The marriage of IXD and UXD in Game Design and Methodology

## Technology
Over the semester we will work in 3 major applications. Please have downloaded:
1. [Adobe Muse](http://muse.adobe.com/) (CC Subscription Required)
2. [Adobe Xd](http://www.adobe.com/products/experience-design.html) (CC Subscription Required)
3. [Unity Personal](https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal) (Free)

## Class Goals
This is not an engineering course, meaning you will not be required to thoroughly learn a language or the back-end operations of an application. Nor is this strictly an art course - I'm not expecting visual masterpieces. This class is about communication and commercial media practices, and the process of overcoming design challenges.

I don't want you to avoid mistakes and accidents; I want you to embrace them!

It is hoped that after completing the course, you'll have a deeper understanding of how data is looped, assimilated, and applied in digital media, including:

- How to use interactive media software to create functioning sketches of web sites, apps, and games.
- How these sketchs are tested, and how this test data is catalogued and studied.
- How to rely on quality assurance to produce the best possible product for a target user.
- How to apply and prioritize changes within quick production timelines.
- How to enjoy this wonderful community in the digital age!
