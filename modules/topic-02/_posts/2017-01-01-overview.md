It may seem strange to discuss architecture in a Digital Media course, but this practice is incredibly influential on our everyday perspectives, artistic or not.

We will begin this Topic looking at architecture in the traditional sense, move into integration of technology and physical construction, and conclude with the purely digital infrastructure of websites.

To begin, let's briefly continue our exploration of "design spacial awareness," transitioning from objects to environments. Have you considered how the space around you influences your personal atmosphere? Provides inspiration? Responds to your physiological, psychological, or cultural needs?

This may seem like a nonsensical thing to think about, but this is an integral design consideration for many contemporary architects. Architecture is transtioning to the nearly spiritual, _responding_ to events and even _interacting_ with its communities on an enormous scale.

To illustrate, can you think of a site whose structures (past and present) have become so culturally relavent they define a nation?
