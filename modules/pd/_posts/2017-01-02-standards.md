"In 1904, a fire broke out in the basement of the John E. Hurst & Company Building in Baltimore. After taking hold of the entire structure, it leaped from building to building until it engulfed an 80-block area of the city. To help combat the flames, reinforcements from New York, Philadelphia and Washington, DC immediately respondedâ€”but to no avail. Their fire hoses could not connect to the fire hydrants in Baltimore because they did not fit the hydrants in Baltimore. Forced to watch helplessly as the flames spread, the fire destroyed approximately 2,500 buildings and burned for more than 30 hours."*

One of humankind's greatest achievements is _standardization_, or a community's agreement on a set of rules or regulations regarding systems. Money, measurements, and time are all socially- or scientifically-agreed upon constructs.

### Why do we talk about it?

The Digital Age is a by-product of the creation of standards regarding computing development and languages. Many of you are familiar with **web standards** which govern the creation and proliferation of web languages, like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through these standards, web designers have agreed on a set of best pracitices and design philopsophies that keep the web accessible across browsers, regions, and even the phsycial abilities of its users.

### What Does This Mean For Me?

You make products and experiences. These may be websites, digital art, interactive installations, video games, or films. Every "thing" you make has a story to tell. As we progress through the semester, we'll look at design standards and philosophies, and how we can use them to better create these experiences and communicate with audiences.

#### Have you considered what your design philosophy is?
