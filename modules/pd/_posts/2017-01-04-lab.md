Now that you've thought about your interactions with physical items, let's navigate to the meat of what we study: digital interfaces and experiences.

Usability.gov is the leading resource for **user experience** (UX) best practices and guidelines, serving practitioners and students in the government and private sectors.  It provides overviews of the user-centered design process and various UX disciplines, and also covers the related information on methodology and tools for making digital content more usable and useful.

Take a look around. Pay particular attention to these pages:
- [User Interface Design Basics](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-interface-design.html)
- [Acessibility Basics](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/accessibility.html)
- [Usability Evaluation Basics](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/usability-evaluation.html)

### Lab: Usability & U

For your Lab this topic, I want you to find a random website via [Discuvver.com](https://www.discuvver.com/), and evaluate your expierence with it using the "Basics of Usability Evaluation" practices you read about.

In short-answer format, please:
1. List and briefly describe the site you visited.
2. From your exploration, what is its primary purpose? How fast were you able to discern this? (FYI, it should be less than 5 seconds.)
3. List a positive aspect and negative aspect to your experience. What worked, and what failed?
4. If it asked you to perfom an action (subscribe, search, submit), how intuitive was this experience?
5. What changes do you think would improve this site? Perhaps in **one** of these fields:
  - _User Interface_ - navigation, input controls, consistancy, etc.
  - _Visual Design_ - color, graphics, typography, layout, responsiveness, etc.
  - _Accessibility_ - contrast, use of images, use of media subtitles/transcripts, etc.
