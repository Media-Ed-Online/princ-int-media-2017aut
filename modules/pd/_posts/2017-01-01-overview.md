This course is all about **interaction,**  or how respond, develop, and communicate with the world around us. We do this a number of ways in the arts; through our devices, through our collaborators, and through the iterative processes behind designing and producing our products.

But before that, before we code, before we create, before we publish...

Have you ever thought about "things?" The objects that make up our daily lives? Who made them, for what purpose? If you could _re-make_ them, if you _are_ making them, what do they look like, how do they work? What is your interaction with or _reaction_ to these "things," and does that change or adapt?

Before we get to making digital products, we should take a moment to look at the phsyical world around us, and how **industrial design** and **product design** has lead to the world we know today.
