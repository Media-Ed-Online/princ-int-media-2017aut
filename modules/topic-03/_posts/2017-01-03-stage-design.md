</div>In film, the production design and cinematography work together to force the viewer to look at an important part of the screen. This is not interactive, but it <i>does</i> illicit reaction from the audience. Kubrick in particular was a master at using a compostional technique called "one-point perspective" to enhance the atmosphere created by his cinematic spaces.</p>

"The composition of these shots draws the viewer's eye to a specific focal point within the frame, absorbing them into the dimension of the shot and manipulating the experience by telling them exactly where to look. It also elicits an emotional response, typically of uneasiness or dread... Even when nothing is happening, putting our focus on a particular point makes us wonder when something will, creating an environment of tension and anticipation." ([Filmmaker's Handbook](http://screenprism.com/insights/article/the-filmmakers-handbook-what-is-one-point-perspective))

Like architecture, cinema is solid - it has permanence and we can watch a film over and over again. But what happens when we add _time_ to the mixture? Or better yet: multi-point perspectives?

This is something stage designers and installation artists need to consider constantly, because not only are they creating "moments in time" rather than permanent pieces, they often have to be viewable and enjoyable from multiple angles (such as concert venues and [theatre in the round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_in_the_round)).

Learning how stage designers apply these practices is critical to understanding how we as digital artsts can creat immersive, psychological experiences that outlast the methods which created them. Remember, graphics are the first thing to go out of style, and they go out _fast._ Solidity needs to be found in experience, not only structure.


### Abstract: The Art of Design<br />"Episode 03: Es Devlin on Stage Design"

"Es Devlin is widely considered to be the world’s foremost set designer. She is an architect of temporary space, making images that can survive only in the minds of the people who see her shows. “I do all this work and nothing physical remains,” she told me. “So what <span style="color: #33A3C1">I’m really designing</span> are <span style="color: #33A3C1">mental structures</span> as opposed to physical ones. Memories are solid, and that’s what I’m trying to build.”

In theatre terms, this is the age of Es Devlin. She is theatre’s postmodern expert, and has an instinctive sense of how Shakespeare and opera and fashion and pop concerts might draw from the same dark web of psychological information. Each of her designs is an attack on the notion that a set is merely scenery. She is in demand because she can enter the psychic ether of each production and make it glow with significance."
