An audience can have different roles in any arena, be it a film, theatre, or interactive production. Designers use patterns, time, and psychology to direct how we interact with a space or how that space interacts with _us_. Going forward, it's critical you consider how your design choices will effect the overall atmosphere ("space") of your work, and how it could potentially communicate your personal experiences with others.

Focused on music, art, and youth culture, British magazine [i-D](https://i-d.vice.com/en_us) also holds worldwide exhibitions. "In our first artistic project for _The Fifth Sense_, a partnership between Chanel and i-D, stage designer Es Devlin considers the philosophical idea of scent - conjuring a multi-sensory world within an immersive installation created in Peckham, Southeast London, inspired by Chanel Fragrance.

"Viewers online can experience the installation via the film she has created for the work, a "video sculpture" exploring the idea of the loss of control, an analog for the way scent bypasses the front of our brains and can immediately access emotion, memory, time and place."
