For our second lab with Adobe Muse, we're going to have a little fun with scroll effects. Similar to parallax design, scroll effects are a Muse tool that allows you to create dynamic effects for a website. This is a web design technique that enables you to set the speed and direction of each element in your web page as a user interacts with it by scolling.

You can control the motion settings of elements, change the opacity, configure the playback settings of a Slideshow widget, and work with animation content through scroll effects.

<!--How does this all tie together? Let's piece our material together for moment.

Production designers create spaces that are illustrative, and are experienced from a distance (on a screen).

Stage designers create spaces that are illustrative and ephemeral, and are dependedent on in-person audience.

Interaction designers create spaces on a screen experienced in-person, which are also illustrative and ephemeral.

We've compared the structure of websites to the principles of traditional architecture, in that the actual design processes are quite similar. But unlike "brick and mortar" structures, websites are not static. They can include a myriad of interactive elements, and should be designed to adapt to user needs, be this screen size, time-sensitive content, or anything else.

Websites, in their easiest definition, act as a communication device between a service and a client. This could be a business and a customer, an artist and a fan, or an educator and a student. Interaction designers
