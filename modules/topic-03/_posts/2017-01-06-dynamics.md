Apple comes up often in these sorts of discussions because of its [focus on user-centered design](https://developer.apple.com/library/content//documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/OSXHIGuidelines/Strategies.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000957-CH19-SW1). **User-centered design** relies on having a deep understanding of who will be using the product. Usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks, and workflow of a product, service, or process are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process.
