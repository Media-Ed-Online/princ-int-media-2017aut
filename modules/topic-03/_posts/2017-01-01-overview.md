Architecture is largely a practice in permanence - creating structures the enforce abstract concepts, yes, but limited by their needs for solidity and longevity. The majority of constructions are designed to last, be self-sustaining, and are _usually_ unmoving.

But this is not the only field of design that uses statues and structures to create meaning or experiences - far from it. The number one ingredient to any design is **space**; whether it's an artboard, three-column web layout, or walls of an installation, we all begin with space, and the first step in our creative process is deciding what to do with it.

We started with objects, and transitioned into three-dimensional environments. Let's continue this train by adding the fourth-dimension - _time_ - and how there is power in the ephemeral, kinetic, and fluid.

We'll focus first on Production and Stage Design, then spend some time with Interaction Design (IxD) proper and how these concepts are applied websites and their dynamic elements.
