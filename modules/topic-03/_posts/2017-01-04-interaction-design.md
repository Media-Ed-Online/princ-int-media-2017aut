Controlling perspective works in cinema and other passive media, but not for the interactive arts. With film, the adage is _the viewer as observer_. With interaction, it shifts to _the viewer as participant_. This can get tricky because it's still so new to us, but now that we have some experience with traditional, physical forms and designs, let's begin our transition into the digital world of interactive interfaces and processes.

### "What is IxD?"

"Interaction Design (IxD) defines the structure and behavior of interactive systems. Interaction designers strive to **create meaningful relationships between people and the products and services that they use**, from computers to mobile devices to appliances and beyond. Our practices are evolving with the world." ([The Interaction Design Association](http://www.ixda.org/about/ixda-mission) (IxDA))


### Common Methodologies

Interaction designers are interested in specific interactions between users and their screens, unlike **user experience designers** which need to account for all aspects of the user-facing system. Common methodologies behind IxD inlcude:

#### Goal-Driven Design

Goal-driven design focuses on satisifiying specific needs and desires of the end-user, not the total capabilities of the techonology. It holds problem solving as the higest priority of the design, and states that designers have a responsibility to combine both the needs of _end-users_ and _stakeholders_ (business owners) to the best of the product's abilities.


#### Cognitive Psychology

This is a broad field with a lot of dedicated study. For our purposes, we as designers need to understand that users have expectations (conscious and unconsious) about how a product should behave. This means making products that are intuitive, and use common practices like _interface metaphors_ (the trash icon resembles a physical trash can in both graphics and purpose) and _affordances_ (a website button looking like a physical button you can push is an affordance designed so that unfamilar users will still understand how to interact with it).


#### Usability

Usability, in simple terms, address how easy the product is to access. This includes _learnability_ (how quickly can a new user learn the interface?), _errors_ (how many errors can me made, and how are they addressed), and _efficiency_ (how quickly tasks can be performed), among others.


#### The Five Dimensions

We may consider "interaction design language" to consist of five dimensions which make up the interactions themeselves between the user and the screen.

1. 1D: Words
2. 2D: Visual Representation
3. 3D: Physical Objects or Space
4. 4D: Time
5. 5D: Behavior

We use these dimensions to break down the experience a user has when communicating with the system. See the next page for more.


### "Why is it Important?"

"We are in a society where automation and algorythms are taking over lots of decision processes. We as designers can bring the human point-of-view into complex systems. Interaction designers are in a position where they are enablers of connecting people to people [again]."
