We'll spend the rest of the semester discussing the process of developing interactive games; both by building our own, and playing a real-world title.

Developing a game may seem like an impossible task, but it's not. Game development is more approachable than it ever has been, particularly because it has become easier and easier to communicate with computers through intermediary programs, like game engines. A perfect culmination of interaction and user experience design, games are the ultimate in interactive entertainment.

You will begin your final lab this week, and work on it at your own pace. It will be due at the end of the semester. The lab "parts" are available to you in four digestable chunks starting with Part I provided in this Topic, but you may move on to further parts whenever you're ready.

Before you get too far, please select and purchase a 2D platformer to play for your upcoming Group Think discussions. Choices are available on the page "[Let's Play](../games-selection)."
