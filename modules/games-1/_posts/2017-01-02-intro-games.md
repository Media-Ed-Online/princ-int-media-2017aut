As you get through our next and final lab, it'll become clearer how games are _interactive experiences_ and the newest media that utilizes creative communication to tell stories between creater, user, and device.

Games have come a long way in a very short time, and are still learning how to use IxD and UxD practices to create working environments that immerse players in artifical worlds. Over the last handful of "Group Think" forums we'll explore some of the elements of game design that accomplish this, utilizing a game you select on the next page.

### Let's Define:


#### What is a Game?

#### What is a Game Genre?

Just like with film and literature, video games are categorized by **genre**. Unlike film and literature genres, however, game genres detail a game's type of challenge, rather than its contents. There are umbrella genres like "action" and specific sub-genres, like "shooter" or "survival."

For example, you can have fantasy, adventure, or role-playing games that have completely different goals, but can all be categorized as platformers. A **platformer** (either 2D or 3D) is, at its core, a game where players must jump over suspended platforms or obstacles to complete challenges.

Many early video games were platformers, such as _Super Mario Bros._ (1985) and _Sonic the Hedgehog_ (1991). This genre has made a large resurgance since the game engines have become widely available due to its lower-learning curve and tried-and-true mechanics.

#### What is a Game Engine?

A **game engine** is basically a software development kit on which to build games. Games can be built without using a engine, but having access to pre-developed toolkits, libraries, and scripts can greatly ease and speed-up the creation process. Consider travelling from Point A to Poit B. You can get there by walking, but it's faster and more efficient to drive - although more costly.
