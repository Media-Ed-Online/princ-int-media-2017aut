_Websites, apps, and games, oh my!_ Congratulations on making it to the end, to see all your study come to fruition!

"Just like websites or the apps on your phone, video games are just computer programs, [and] we make them by giving instructions to a computer or video game console... These instructions can be stored in your harddrive or even in a CD-rom, and they are things like 'make a character appear in the middle of the screen,' or 'when the player hits the up arrow key, make the character jump.'"
