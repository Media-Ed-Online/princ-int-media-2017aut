Game design is a huge field. Professional development can take years, and there are entire schools and majors dedicated to _specific_ areas of game development, much less "the whole process."

We may be small, but we're glad to offer you additional (and excellent) places to go if you're interested in learning more.

### 2D Physics: Slinding & Bouncing
Sliding and Bouncing are all controlled by a Physics Material applied to a Collider Component. In this video they set up both Bouncy and Slippery 2D Physics Materials, and apply them to GameObjects.
