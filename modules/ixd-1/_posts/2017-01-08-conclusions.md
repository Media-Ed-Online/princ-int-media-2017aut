Digital artists are builders. We create a foundation, then add, subtract, and manipulate layers, vectors, codes, commands, and tracks.

By understanding traditional architecture we as craftsmen and women can learn how to give strength and stability to foundational concepts like form and layout. By utilizing digital technologies we can add fludity and dynamics and create _experiences_ with these foms based on our creative visions.
