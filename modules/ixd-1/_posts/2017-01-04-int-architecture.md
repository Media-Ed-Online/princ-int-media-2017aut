"**Interactive architecture** refers to the branch of architecture which deals with buildings featuring the trio of sensors, processors and effectors, embedded as a core part of its nature and functioning. Interactive architecture encompasses building automation but goes beyond it by including forms of interaction engagements and responses that may lay in pure communication purposes as well as in the emotive and artistic realm, thus entering the field of Interactive Art."

There are many different studios specializing in this field. Here are just a few:

#### CiniMod Studios
Visit: [http://www.cinimodstudio.com/](http://www.cinimodstudio.com/)

A cross-discipline practice based in London, Cinimod Studio specialises in the fusion of architecture and lighting design. With a passion for interactive art and lighting schemes, architect and artist Dominic Harris founded the studio in 2007, which has since produced numerous projects spanning across the international art and architecture landscapes.

<p style="font-size: small; color: #999">"Finial Response" is a permanent interactive public artwork in the bustling heart of Soho in London which blurs the boundaries between architecture and art. The artwork covers 20 meters at street level and consists of 109 individually shaped black steel profiles sandwiching illuminated acrylic which responds to the movements of passers-by. Each profile shape echoes ornamental finials found around Westminster, connecting Soho’s decorated past with its new incarnation as a media hub.</p>

#### The Living

The Living, a first-of-its-kind Autodesk Studio, explores the future by building full-scale functioning prototypes today. Their projects apply generative design, biology, and new materials to real-built projects in the context of technology, culture, and the environment. Recently, The Living was ranked third by Fast Company in its list of World’s Most Innovative Companies in Architecture.

<p style="font-size: small; color: #999">"HIVE" is an architectural-scale pavilion at Autodesk University 2015 woven together and built through human and robot collaboration. This project forefronts a combination of experimental technologies focused on pushing the boundaries of design and construction, including: tensegrity structures, generative design, robot construction, and interactive wearable computing. Robots (UR-10) were provided by Universal Robotics.</p>

#### The Interactive Architecture Lab
Visit: [http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/](http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/)

The Interactive Architecture Lab at UCL is interested in the Behaviour and Interaction of Things, Environments and their Inhabitants. The Lab is engaged in a range of academic research activities and industry collaborations. At its heart is the 15-month Masters programme "MArch Design for Performance & Interaction," which gives students an opportunity to exploit the potential of new sensing, computation, networked and responsive technologies to imagine, build and test new spaces of performance & interaction.

<p style="font-size: small; color: #999;">The "[Sarotis Project](http://www.interactivearchitecture.org/lab-projects/sarotis)" presents a two phased study: a series of technical experiments and a speculative film. First an experimental prosthesis was designed to study whether a person’s awareness of space could be amplified using live 3D scanning technologies controlling the inflation and deflation of our soft robotic wearable. Results were successful and suggested possible applications for people with visual impairments. It also revealed the possibility of constructing virtual spaces within physical space that could be sensed through it.</p>
