### Let's Define:

#### Scrolling
"Scrolling or Panning refers to any attempt to display a scene that is larger than what fits in a single screen. There are many potential challenges with scrolling, like choosing what the player needs to see, what we as designers would like the player to focus on, and how to do it in a way thatâ€™s fluid and comfortable for the player."
